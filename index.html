    <p>Ladder was inspired by midcentury menus, family diners, and art deco typography. I wanted each design choice to feel familiar but elevated—combining playful illustration, soft geometric forms, and a restrained palette that shifts with the time of day. The ladder anchors the brand to comfort food that carries you upward.

    <p>The visual identity of Ladder needed to match the restaurant’s comforting fare. My work included menu design, illustration, layout, and brand storytelling. Each menu—Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Drinks, and Dessert—features a custom graphic treatment and color palette, all tied together by a recurring ladder motif that reinforces the brand’s name.
